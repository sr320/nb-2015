#No Code Required

Today Sam and I took care of the daily maintenance of F2 Olympia oysters grown at the Ken Chew Shellfish Hatchery at Manchester, WA. In short, larvae are being described from Fidalgo (North: NF), Oyster Bay (South: SS), and Hood Canal (HC) broodstock.  Though I had done most aspects before, never without Katherine, thus she [provided instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NtuR62_2tEYOeZrkgV5CbwIWcu3PT1rFuOu9vuZlwrw/edit?hl=en&forcehl=1).

When I arrived the algae tank was empty and pump was off.

The system was flushed with freshwater (with Sam soaked with said water) along with bleach. The algae tank was filled. The first set of tanks that were processed were the larger larvae (+160um).

Using 100um screen larvae were collected, brought up in 800ml and 0.5ml (x3) taken for counts.

The remaining larvae were placed back into cleaned systems.

Next, the smaller larvae tanks were processed, using 160 over 100 um screens, with larger ones moving over to +160um tanks (above). For this counts were done for both size classes and DNA samples taken for 160 size class. The smaller larvae placed back in the same tanks.

For DNA samples, 4mls of larvae from 800ml beaker were taken, rinsed with ethanol and placed in 1.5ml centrifuge tube with 1ml of RNAlater (This was also done with fresh larvae- below).

The last systems tackled were the "new", fresh larvae from collectors..

For this, larvae were captured using 200um / 100um screen, with larvae moved to larger tanks, counts done, and samples collected for DNA. As expected very little larvae, **they were brought up in 400ml, 1ml used for counting, and 8ml used for DNA samples**.

Sam counted the larvae, probably still very wet (Sam and the larvae).

And here are the counts!
