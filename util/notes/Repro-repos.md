#Reproducing with Repos

While we can certainly improve on our efforts to make our work open and reproducible, we have published a series of products over the last few years that have had associated code/data repositories that have accompanied the narratives (aka manuscripts). I will try to recap said efforts here as a means to show others different options, as well as point out ways we can improve going forward.


###Case #1 
>Gavery MR, Roberts SB. (2013) Predominant intragenic methylation is associated with gene expression characteristics in a bivalve mollusc. PeerJ 1:e215 <https://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.215>

This was one of our early efforts where we provided the ability to view genomic feature tracks in Integrative Genomics Viewer (http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/) and SQLShare query used to derive the methylation feature track from the original methratio output (http://goo.gl/5LGq9Q).
